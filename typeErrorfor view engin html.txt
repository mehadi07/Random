 
To make the render engine accept html instead of jade you can follow the following steps;

    Install consolidate and swig to your directory.

     npm install consolidate
     npm install swig

    add following lines to your app.js file

    var cons = require('consolidate');

    // view engine setup
    app.engine('html', cons.swig)
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'html');

    add your view templates as .html inside “views” folder. Restart you node server and start the app in the browser.

Though this will render html without any issue, I would recommend you to use JADE by learning it. Jade is an amazing template engine and learning this will help you achieve better design & scalability.
